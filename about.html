<h1>Purpose of this Blog</h1>
<p>I enjoy reading the weekly and monthly reports from Redfin, Realtor.com,  Zillow, and NAR about the latest trends in the housing market in the US. The bay area has a unique housing market that doesn’t always follow nationwide trends, and a lot of aspects of the local market are extreme (prices, valuation swings, migration, etc.). I wanted to create a blog that analyzed the the trends and changes in the local housing market, while being able to explore other real estate topics. The sites mentioned above release weekly and monthly data on the the market at a county level, so I wanted to analyze the 9 bay area county’s data and also compare that to the rest or the country.</p>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<p>I wanted this blog to utilize a bunch of different data sources to help me better understand real estate from of many different angles.</p>

<h3>Methodology/Notes</h3>
<p>National housing data differed slightly between the different data sources, based on when they release data, what types of homes are included, and how they calculate certain values. For example, the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) is a smoothed, seasonally adjusted value of homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range. I chose to use the data provided by Realtor.com, because I was mainly inspired by their weekly and monthly data reports (as well as their others, like market hotness reports) they publish (although the others also publish regular reports), and I have been using their data to start making charts in Tableau. </p>
<p>I’m more interested in using at list prices rather than home values, to see what inventory’s like and how the market is.</p>
