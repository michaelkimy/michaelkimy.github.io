<p>California’s exodus during the pandemic continued through 2022, as people who could work remotely sought out more space and cheaper alternatives to California’s extremely high home prices.</p>

<p>A similar exodus has been happening within California, where people have been moving from expensive coastal markets further into the state, also in search of more space and affordability. The Central Valley, for example, have seen an influx of demand in their local housing markets.</p>
    
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau provides an annual <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.All.List_58029271.html#list-tab-List_58029271"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">population estimate</a> for municipalities across the country. To estimate annual populations, the Bureau combines metrics like birthrates, deaths, and migration with geographical boundaries for cities, then factor in people living in various facilities. More information on the U.S. Census Bureau's estimate methodology can be found <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/2021-subco-method.pdf"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
    
<p>According to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, California’s population California saw small population increases of less than 1% in each year between 2010 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the exodus precipitated by the pandemic, California’s population declined by 0.03% in 2020 and by 0.66% in 2021, bringing the most recent population estimate to 39,237,836.</p>

<p>The first map reveals that people were already moving from the cities around the Bay further into the East Bay, South Bay, and further into California before the pandemic. Major inland cities from Redding and Chico in the north, to Sacramento, Stockton, and through Fresno in the south all saw population increases in the two years before the COVID-19 pandemic began. Most cities along the Bay were already experiencing slight population declines prior to the pandemic. As housing prices and rents continues increasing in San Jose throughout the 2010s, smaller surrounding markets like Milpitas and Fremont became appealing as they offered better affordability for housing and saw population growth during this time. Similarly, as San Francisco’s housing market became ever more expensive, although the city’s population slightly increased, surrounding markets like Oakland were popular destinations for many people.</p>

<p>This trend seemed to only intensify during the pandemic, as remote work, extra savings, and low rates led many people to seek extra space in the cheaper markets. Almost all cities around the Bay saw population declines, and many cities that saw population increases from 2017 to 2019 faced rapid declines as people moved even further inland or out of state.</p>

<p>The overall population changes between 2017 to 2021 are very similar to the 2019 to 2021 changes, due to the fact that the changes during the pandemic were much larger than in the two prior years for most cities.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Predictions for 2022 data and for 2023</h2>

<p>Population estimates for 2022 will not be released until May, so it will be interesting to find out how populations have changed in the third year of the pandemic. 2022 was notable in that soaring inflation caused a fear of a recession that remained throughout the year. The stock market saw historic declines throughout the year, and the country also continued facing issues in the housing market as mortgage rates doubled while housing prices were above 2021’s all-time highs. The economic downturn and decline in affordability have put a damper on the public’s willingness and ability to move towards the suburbs in search of more space. The data for 2022 will likely show a decrease in migration throughout the Bay Area.</p>

<p>As we transitioned into 2023, the good news is that inflation seems to have already peaked, and the same is true with housing prices and mortgage rates. However, economic hardships will continue for at least the bulk of the year, and so I expect the Bay Area to experience lower levels of migration like in 2022 compared to 2017 to 2021.</p>

<p>Even with recent declines, housing prices in the largest cities like San Francisco and San Jose remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, so I still expect smaller suburbs of the Bay Area to be popular migration destinations in the future for those looking for cheaper alternatives to their $1.3 and $1.2 million respective average home prices as of the end of 2022. Those that have the savings and the job security to move out will likely take advantage of the growing inventory and recent declines in home prices. Ongoing layoffs and other economic troubles for the technology industry will likely put downward pressure demand for housing in the larger cities as well.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">(maybe don’t include, possibly next article)</h2>

<p>Changes in populations directly affect a region’s housing market, as a decrease in demand puts downward pressure on prices. By understanding the migration patterns within the Bay Area, one could hope to better predict how local housing markets will change with regards to price, inventory, and demand. </p>
