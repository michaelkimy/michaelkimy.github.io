<h1 class="post-heading">Bay Area Real Estate Update for October 2022</h1>

<h4 class="section-heading">Key Findings - October 2022</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The 30-year rate rose steeply, surpassing 7% to end the month at 7.08%</li>
    <li>Median Listing Prices dropped slightly throughout the Bay Area, and dropped 0.5% nationwide</li>
    <li>Active Listings rose slightly throughout the Bay Area, and increased 3% nationwide</li>
    <li>The rise in the 30-year fixed rate means that the average mortgage payment (Principal and Interest) increased by 8% from September to $7,113/month in SF.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-heading">30-Year Fixed Rate</h4>

<img src="/../img/posts/10-2022/30-year-rate.png" alt="30-Year Fixed Rate">

<p>The 30-year fixed rate has increased at a historic pace this year, and it continued to climb this past month, reaching 7.08% by the end of the month. The rate increased by 0.38% through October. The increase in the 30-year rate can be attributed to the Fed’s ongoing fight with inflation. There is a glimmer of hope, however. The latest CPI inflation numbers this month were slightly lower than expected, which were a good sign that inflation may be starting to ease. Inflation is still higher than the Fed would like, but if the Fed can continue to make headway, the rate may end up leveling out below 8%. </p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Median List Price</h3>

<p>San Francisco was one of the few Bay Area counties to see an increase in median list price through October, increasing just 0.22% to $1.35M. San Francisco had a year-over-year increase of 2.86%, up from $1.313M in October 2021. </p>

<img src="/../img/posts/10-2022/bay-area-price-table.png" alt="Bay Area Median List Price Table" class="center">

<p>San Mateo had the only significant increase in median list price from last month, increasing 3.13% to a Bay Area-high of $1.649M. Most other counties in the Bay Area saw slight decreases this month, likely due to higher borrowing costs and an overheated market finally cooling down a little. All 9 of the Bay Area’s counties trail the national average of 13.33% YoY increases, however, while mostly outperforming the state average of 2.14%. </p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Affordability</h3>

<img src="/../img/posts/10-2022/sf-mortgage-payment.png" alt="San Francisco Mortgage Payment">

<p>The monthly mortgage payment needed for a San Francisco home for sale has skyrocketed this year, increasing 8.8% to $8,457/month with a 5% down payment, and $7,113/month with 20% down. The cost of a mortgage on homes for sale have increased an astonishing 59.2% since a year ago, and the increases have blown the cost of buying a home in SF way past pre-pandemic levels. </p>

<img src="/../img/posts/10-2022/us-mortgage-payment.png" alt="National Mortgage Payment">

<p>The average monthly mortgage cost to buy a home in U.S. has had an extreme increase throughout 2022. The current mortgage cost in October 2022 is 8.0% more than in September and is 75.7% higher than in October 2021. The extremely quick increase in mortgage rates this year, along with the continued increase in home values since the start of the pandemic, have made the homes currently for sale much more expensive. This has forced many buyers to stretch their budgets or be priced out of the current market.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Inventory</h2>

<img src="/../img/posts/10-2022/us-active-listings.png" alt="National Active Listings">

<p>Active listings throughout the Bay Area this year have resembled the pre-pandemic annual cycle of inventory. The Bay Area, like most places around the county, follow seasonal cycle of inventory, which includes a steep rise in active listings from the end of winter through the spring and summer, followed by a steep drop through the later parts of the year. Throughout the pandemic, the Bay Area experienced a dampened version of this cycle, where the inventory levels were reduced in 2020 and even more in 2021. Inventory reached their lowest point since 2018 in January of this year. The reduction in inventory was much less pronounce in the Bay Area, where the 2022 lows were at around the same levels of inventory as 2018. This contrasts with the nationwide active listing low of 347,000 in February compared to the 1.042 million active listings at the beginning of 2018. Many Bay Area counties experienced surges this year more reminiscent of pre-pandemic times but remains lower than 2019 levels in most counties. Despite a strong surge and being at their higher levels of this year, active listings nationwide remain low at 753,000 compared to their 2019 highs of 1.238 million. </p>

<p>San Francisco is the only county in the Bay Area that has consistently had more active listings during the pandemic than in 2018 and 2019. San Francisco had an anomalous increase in inventory from April to October of 2020, and levels remained higher than 2018 and 2019 levels for all of 2021. This year has seen a strong increase and the active listing count stand at 1,411 in October, right between 2020 and 2021 levels, and about 500 more than 2018 and 2019.  </p>

<p>Note: Since this is the first installment of this monthly update, this post is longer than future monthly updates will be. This is the first time combing through these datasets, so I have made more long-term analyses to different years and comparing recent years to pre-pandemic norms. Future monthly updates will only offer snapshots of the changes for the given month, including MoM and YoY changes, but won't look back and compare to previous times. Much of that analyses would have been covered in this report. </p>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
