<h1 class="post-heading">My REI Ideas</h2>

<p>Despite the recent declines in home prices in San Francisco, home prices in the city remain above $1.3m in the city, representing a significant barrier to a new investor with little money like me. </p>

<p>From what I have seen and have heard online, the main driver of success in investing in real estate in San Francisco is long-term appreciation. Appreciation in San Francisco has far exceeded the national average over the long run, like most other cities throughout the Bay Area, averaging X% annually since X. Prices in San Francisco have increased from X in X to X today, presenting an X% return to those that bought and held real estate. San Francisco’s residential real estate market can also be hit especially hard in recessions, due to recessions impacting the technology industry especially hard. However, it is those that buy and hold real estate in the area that get to reap the benefits of the Bay Area’s continuous home appreciation. </p>

<p>In looking for strategies in beginning my real estate investing journey, San Francisco seemed like the obvious place to start. After all, I grew up in the city and have also planned on living here for the long-term. But seeing tiny studios and empty lots selling for over $800,000 and modest homes selling for well over a million, the barrier to entry seemed too high to overcome. Even homes on the lower end of the price scale tend to need significant renovations, which would add to the already high down payment requirements. And once you factor in cashflow, it’s difficult to come up with any scenario where the numbers look remotely like a good deal. A million-dollar home that brings in $40,000 in rent would still cost you thousands of dollars each month. Even a multifamily property with both units rented out would be very difficult to achieve a positive cash flow. The only real way to cash flow in SF is with a low mortgage payment, but that requires having a large sum of cash and holding it up in the property, not to mention the lower cash-on-cash return.</p>

<p>In VHCOL, home prices are very disproportionate to rent prices. For example, the price-to-rent ratio is SF is X, compared to the national average of X. </p>

<p>I now believe stronger in the idea that expensive markets are best for those with money to park a large sum of it to diversify their portfolios and count on appreciation to offer a return. It seems like these wealthy individuals are more concerned with purchasing a home rather than just an investment.</p>

<p>And most people that buy a home in SF are more interested in purchasing a property to call home rather than an investment.</p>

<p>All this said, I do think San Francisco presents a unique opportunity to invest in, eventually. I picture San Francisco as a market that I may buy in further down in the future, when I want to settle down and I can afford the exuberant prices. So, I look towards other markets. </p>

<p>Almost all advice I have seen offered online to those looking to begin investing in San Francisco and other VHCOL areas essentially the same thing: invest elsewhere, preferably out of state. The Midwest was almost always suggested as the best place, since the region has seen some of the highest price growth while remaining at or below the national average. I’ve considered this approach, however the thought of having to find an agent, mortgage broker, contractors, and others remotely, as well have writing offers on properties I haven’t seen, in areas I am not familiar with, all seems overwhelming to me. So, I look a little closer to home.</p>

<p>Growing up in San Francisco, I’m admittedly not too familiar with the rest of the Bay Area. I’ve been to a lot of other cities in the region, but I know close to nothing about their local markets. But the idea of being able to drive and go see the property and meet with people in person seems like a much better place for a newbie like me to start. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
