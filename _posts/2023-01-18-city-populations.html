<p>California’s exodus during the pandemic continued through 2022, as people who could work remotely sought out more space and cheaper alternatives to California’s extremely high home prices.</p>

<p>A similar exodus has been happening within California, where people have been moving from expensive coastal markets further into the state, also in search of more space and affordability. The Central Valley, for example, have seen an influx of demand in their local housing markets.</p>
    
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau provides an annual <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.All.List_58029271.html#list-tab-List_58029271">population estimate</a> for municipalities across the country. To estimate annual populations, the Bureau combines metrics like birthrates, deaths, and migration with geographical boundaries for cities, then factor in people living in various facilities. More information on the U.S. Census Bureau's estimate methodology can be found <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/2021-subco-method.pdf">here</a>.</p>
    
<p>According to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, California’s population California saw small population increases of less than 1% in each year between 2010 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the exodus precipitated by the pandemic, California’s population declined by 0.03% in 2020 and by 0.66% in 2021, bringing the most recent population estimate to 39,237,836.</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
